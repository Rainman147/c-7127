# Real-Time Connection Management

## Error Handling Patterns

### 1. Connection Errors

Connection errors are handled through a multi-layered approach:

- **Detection**: The `ConnectionStateTracker` monitors connection status changes
- **Classification**: Errors are categorized into:
  - Network errors (disconnection, timeout)
  - Authentication errors
  - Subscription errors
  - Protocol errors
- **Recovery**: Implemented through the retry manager with exponential backoff
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for connection status changes

### 2. Subscription Errors

Subscription-related errors are managed through:

- **Queuing**: Failed subscriptions are queued for retry
- **State Tracking**: Each subscription attempt is tracked with metadata
- **Automatic Recovery**: Queued subscriptions are processed when connection is restored

### 3. Message Handling Errors

Message processing errors are handled by:

- **Validation**: Messages are validated before processing
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries catch rendering errors
- **Retry Logic**: Failed message operations can be retried
- **Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging

### 4. Best Practices

1. Always use the logger with appropriate categories
2. Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
3. Use toast notifications for user-facing errors
4. Track error metrics for monitoring
5. Implement proper error boundaries

### 5. Error Recovery Flow

1. Error occurs and is caught by error handler
2. Error is classified and logged
3. User is notified if appropriate
4. Recovery strategy is determined
5. Retry logic is initiated if applicable
6. Connection state is updated
7. Queued operations are processed when ready
