# Branching Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the branching strategy for evolving our application from a basic chat system to a comprehensive clinical assistant.

## Branch Structure

```
main
└── develop-clinical-assistant
    ├── feature/patient-context
    │   ├── patient-data-model
    │   ├── temporal-tracking
    │   └── medical-history
    │
    ├── feature/template-engine
    │   ├── clinical-templates
    │   ├── validation-rules
    │   └── smart-defaults
    │
    ├── feature/emr-integration
    │   ├── data-mapping
    │   ├── sync-engine
    │   └── export-formats

    └── feature/clinical-intelligence

        └── pattern-recognition
```

## Branch Descriptions

### Main Branch
- Production-ready code
- Current stable version
- Tagged releases
- Immediate bug fixes only

### develop-clinical-assistant
- Main development branch for new clinical assistant
- Integration branch for feature branches
- Must pass all tests before merging to main
- Contains latest development version

### Feature Branches
Each major feature has its own branch with sub-features:

#### feature/patient-context
- Enhanced patient data model
- Temporal data tracking
- Medical history management
- Vital signs monitoring

#### feature/template-engine
- Clinical documentation templates
- Smart validation rules
- Context-aware defaults
- Medical terminology integration

#### feature/emr-integration
- EMR system connectivity
- Data synchronization
- Export format handlers
- Integration testing

#### feature/clinical-intelligence
- Decision support system
- Risk analysis engine
- Pattern recognition
- Clinical alerts

## Branch Naming Convention
- Feature branches: `feature/[feature-name]`
- Sub-feature branches: `feature/[feature-name]/[sub-feature]`
- Bug fixes: `fix/[issue-number]-[brief-description]`
- Releases: `release/[version]`

## Workflow Guidelines

### 1. Starting New Work
```bash
# Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[feature-name] develop-clinical-assistant

# Create sub-feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]/[sub-feature] feature/[feature-name]
```

### 2. Regular Development
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Keep branches up to date with parent branch
- Write tests for new features

### 3. Code Review Process
- Create pull request to parent branch
- Require minimum 1 reviewer approval
- All tests must pass
- No merge conflicts

### 4. Merging Strategy
```bash
# Update from parent branch
git checkout feature/[feature-name]
git pull origin develop-clinical-assistant

# Merge sub-feature
git merge --no-ff feature/[feature-name]/[sub-feature]
```

### 5. Release Process
- Create release branch from develop-clinical-assistant
- Version bump and changelog update
- Final testing and verification
- Merge to main with version tag

## Migration Considerations

### 1. Database Changes
- Create migration scripts for each feature
- Version control database schema
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Include rollback procedures

### 2. API Versioning
- Version API endpoints
- Maintain compatibility layer
- Document breaking changes
- Provide migration guides

### 3. Feature Flags
- Use feature flags for new functionality
- Enable gradual rollout
- Support A/B testing
- Easy feature toggling

## Quality Assurance

### 1. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for new features
- Integration tests for system components
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
- Performance benchmarks

### 2. Documentation
- Update technical documentation
- Maintain API documentation
- Provide migration guides
- Update user documentation

### 3. Monitoring
- Track feature usage
- Monitor error rates
- Measure performance metrics
- Collect user feedback

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. Hotfix Process
```bash
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/[issue]-[description] main

# After fix
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/[issue]-[description]
git checkout develop-clinical-assistant
git merge --no-ff hotfix/[issue]-[description]
```

### 2. Rollback Procedures
- Document rollback steps for each feature
- Maintain database rollback scripts
- Test rollback procedures
- Monitor system during rollback
